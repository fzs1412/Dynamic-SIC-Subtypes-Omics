Background: The dynamic evolution and molecular basis of Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) remain critical unknowns in sepsis research. This study aimed to identify heterogeneous clinical subtypes of SIC by integrating clinical trajectories with transcriptomic analyses, elucidate their underlying molecular regulatory networks, and develop an early mortality-risk prediction model for high-risk patients.

Methods: We analyzed 1,078 adult sepsis patients from the Chinese Multicenter ICU Sepsis Database (CMAISE). Latent-class trajectory modelling (LCTM) was applied to longitudinal SIC scores during the first five ICU days to delineate clinical trajectories. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the trajectory groups with the greatest prognostic divergence—“high-risk resolving” versus “persistent-severe”—were subjected to longitudinal transcriptomic profiling to reveal dynamic molecular programs driving outcomes. Focusing on patients already meeting SIC criteria at admission, we then developed and validated a machine-learning model for predicting in-hospital mortality.

Results: Four distinct SIC dynamic trajectories with markedly different outcomes were identified. Longitudinal transcriptomics showed that successful recovery is an active “defense-plus-repair” process: resolving patients specifically silenced damage pathways centered on neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) and coagulation cascades, while concurrently activating reparative programs involving cell-cycle regulation, efferocytosis, and immune remodeling. A 23-gene prognostic signature was selected by LASSO regression and used to build a support-vector-machine (SVM) model. In an independent test set, the gene-signature-based SVM achieved an AUC of 0.79 for predicting in-hospital mortality, outperforming models using clinical variables alone.

Conclusion: We delineated dynamic SIC clinical subtypes and uncovered the core molecular mechanism of “damage shutdown and repair initiation.” The validated 23-gene mortality prediction model surpasses traditional clinical indices and could become a powerful tool for early risk stratification and precision intervention in high-risk SIC patients.
