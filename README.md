Purpose: The clinical heterogeneity of sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) poses challenges for patient risk stratification and management. This study aimed to identify dynamic clinical subphenotypes of SIC, elucidate their underlying molecular mechanisms via multi-omics analysis, and evaluate the prognostic value of different molecular data layers (transcriptomics and proteomics) for mortality prediction.
Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed patients with sepsis from a prospective, multicenter observational study conducted across 52 intensive care units (ICUs) in China. Latent Class Trajectory Modeling (LCTM) was applied to perform longitudinal modeling of SIC scores during the first 5 days after ICU admission, for identifying distinct clinical subphenotypes. Subsequently, longitudinal transcriptomic analysis was conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the "High-Risk Resolving" and "Persistently Severe" trajectory groups—those with the most significant prognostic divergence. Comparative proteomic analysis was also performed on plasma samples collected at admission from these two groups. Finally, among high-risk patients who had developed SIC at admission, predictive models for in-hospital mortality based on clinical, transcriptomic, and proteomic data were developed and compared.
Results: Among 394 patients included in the final analysis, four dynamic SIC trajectories with significantly different clinical outcomes were identified. Longitudinal transcriptomic analysis revealed that the recovery process was associated with a dual molecular program: specific suppression of injury-related pathways (e.g., neutrophil extracellular trap formation/NETosis and coagulation cascades) and concurrent activation of repair-related pathways (e.g., cell cycle and efferocytosis). Proteomic analysis validated the differential regulation of these key pathways at the protein level. For mortality prediction in high-risk SIC patients, a logistic regression model based on a 10-gene signature demonstrated excellent performance in cross-validation (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.876, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.858–0.894), which was significantly superior to models based solely on clinical variables (AUC = 0.659) or 6 protein biomarkers (AUC = 0.653).
Conclusion: SIC presents as four dynamic clinical subphenotypes with independent prognostic significance. The resolution of coagulopathy is driven by a dual molecular mechanism that is evident at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. In high-risk SIC patients, transcriptomic profiles at admission provide more robust capacity for death risk stratification compared with clinical variables and plasma proteomic profiles.
